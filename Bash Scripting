Write a bash script that organize a given directory. We have directory containing: music, videos, images, logs and perhaps other files. My task is to organize files into categories and get rid of some of them, after the script has made change, the directory should appear as follows:
-	Anew directory “music” should contain all files with “mp3” and “flac” extension
-	Anew directory ”images” should contain all files with “jpg” and “png” extension
-	Anew directory ”videos” should contain all files with “avi” and “mov” extension
-	Anew directory ”images” should contain all files with “jpg” and “png” extension
All files with the “.log” extension should be removed, other files not already mentioned in this list must not be changed



#!/bin/bash

dir="./"

for file in *
do
extension="${file#*.}"
echo $file
echo $extension
if [ $extension == "mp3" ] || [ $extension == "flac" ];
then
music_directory="music"
mkdir -p $music_directory
mv $file $music_directory
elif [ $extension == "jpg" ] || [ $extension == "png" ];
then
image_directory="images"
mkdir -p $image_directory
mv $file $image_directory
elif [ $extension == "avi" ] || [ $extension == "mov" ];
then
videos_directory="videos"
mkdir -p $videos_directory
mv $file $videos_directory
elif [ $extension == "log" ];
then
rm $file
fi
done
